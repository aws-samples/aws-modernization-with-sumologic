## Sumo Logic AWS Observability Labs

[Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/) is a tested and trusted tool that was born in the AWS Cloud, a committed AWS partner since 2010. Today we are a proud AWS Marketplace Premium Seller and recognized by AWS as a pre-qualified tool that integrates with and can extend AWS services and management APIs to meet unique customer needs.

AWS Marketplace accelerates time-to-contract, provides customers with flexible contracts that help them migrate to the cloud, and implements the controls you need to operate with confidence.

## About these labs

These labs help you identify and resolve issues with services in your infrastructure.

Using root cause analysis tools you can identify possible performance bottlenecks causing bad user experiences, failed services that may need to be restarted and problematic actions taken by users that may result in system failures.

Tracing features allow you to observe apps and microservices at the level of individual requests to pinpoint issues with particular microservices, filtering through trace lists and charts to find troubleshoot faulty transactions.

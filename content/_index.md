# AWS Marketplace DevOps Workshop Series Hands-on Lab with Sumo Logic

Welcome to the Self-Paced Hands-on Lab with Sumo Logic that is part of the AWS Marketplace DevOps Workshop Series. This means that you provide an AWS account where there is IAM user/identity that has proper permissions to set up the necessary AWS components to work through the workshop.

## Lab Overview

In these labs, you will gain experience using Sumo Logic to dive into strategies for:

- Knowing how both front and backend elements of your modern applications interact and perform
- When and where issues arise in your AWS infrastructure
- How to find answers quickly from your traces, metrics and logs

DevOps professionals have many tools and features available in Sumo Logic to determine the roote cause, review logs, and discover traces to identify possible performance issues and failed services, and troubleshoot solutions.

## Sumo Logic and AWS Marketplace

Sumo Logic is available in AWS Marketplace. AWS Marketplace is a digital software catalog that makes it easy to find, try, buy, deploy, and manage software that runs on AWS. AWS Marketplace has a broad and deep selection of ISV solutions that can help you build your ideal DevOps toolchain in the cloud.

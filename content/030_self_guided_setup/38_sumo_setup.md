## Set Up Sumo Logic

You'll need two different browser windows open for the lab activities. In one browser, you will be logged in as yourself, in your own account. In another browser, you'll be logged into a Sumo Logic training lab environment. The training lab environment is separate from your other accounts. So, you'll need to obtain login credentials. 

Log into your Sumo Logic account, click **Home** > **Certification** tab > **Get Certified** to open the [Learning Management System](https://learn.sumologic.com/). Here you will find the email and current password required for these labs. You will use the password in these labs.

To access the training lab environment:

1. Open a new window in a different browser or incognito window. 
1. Navigate to [https://service.sumologic.com](https://service.sumologic.com) in the new browser window. If you are logged in with a personal or company account, log out.
1. Choose a number between 001 and 999. Remember this number, since you'll use it in all your labs.
1. Enter **training+analyst###@sumologic.com** in the **Email** field. Replace **###** with the number you chose in Step 3.
1. Enter the **Password** provided to you by your instructor.

Using separate browsers will keep you logged in to your regular Sumo Logic account and the training lab environment at the same time. If you're reading this on Chrome, open a Firefox window. If you don't have two different browsers on your machine, you can open a Private or Incognito window instead.

In one browser, log in to **your own account**. Use this browser to navigate the lab activities, and take the exam. This way, you'll get credit for taking the course and passing the exam. Make sure you're logged in as yourself by clicking the profile icon in the upper right corner.

In another browser, log in to a **Sumo Logic training lab environment**. You can explore this environment freely, without impacting your dev, prod, or trial environments. Our lab activities are designed for the training lab environment, and may not work in other Sumo Logic accounts.

The training accounts are public. Be careful what kind of personal information you share, like your real name or email address. These training accounts are wiped clean weekly, so make sure you complete any lab activities and save any data you want to keep, as you may not be able to recover it later.

# Workshop Cleanup

For the Sumo Logic Lab Server [https://service.sumologic.com](https://service.sumologic.com), we reset all training analyst accounts on a weekly schedule. You do not need to remove or clear changes you made to the account when working through the labs.

If you run these labs again or take time between labs, you may need to make changes or run the labs again. The training analyst account you selected may have been reset or used by another user.

For details, see [Set Up Sumo Logic](/030_self_guided_setup/38_sumo_setup.html).

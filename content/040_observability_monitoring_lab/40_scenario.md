## Lab 1: Find the Root Cause

Hereâ€™s the scenario you are trying to troubleshoot and isolate the root cause. 

TravelLogic is an app that facilitates travellers booking their flights online and provides the allied services including hotel booking, sight-seeing, and arranging visits to the well-known places at the destination. 

You, a DevOps specialist, are supporting a TravelLogic app on AWS that uses following AWS services:

- Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB, Application Load Balancer)
- Host/Amazon Elastic Comput Cloud (EC2)
- Amazon DynamoDB

#### The Problem to Solve:

The TravelLogic app faces unusual latency in loading the app web page, also sometimes resulting in outage in the us-east-1. You need to find out the root cause of the latency and outages as soon as possible.

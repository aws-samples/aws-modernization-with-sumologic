  {{% /notice %}}

    The trace page opens for the service selected. The window will show a list of traces related to that service, displayed in a table format.

7. Click on the **/get_coffee** operation, to find out what happened to our coffee order.

    {{% notice note %}}
  If you have selected a different service the operation will also have a different name. For example, water service uses get_water.
  {{% /notice %}}

    ![Trace View](/images/lab-monitoring/lab2-trace-view.png)

    This will open the Detail Pane on the right of the screen, on the Summary Tab. You can see the span details of the transaction and related logs below the details. 

8. Click the first Log search to open the logs related to the Span ID.

9. When you go through the logs entry, you will see the cause of the error.  

    {{% notice note %}}
  If you have chosen another serve i.e the water service the error would have occurred due to insufficient water in the coffee machine.
  {{% /notice %}}

10. Inform the barista at the particular error so the problem can be rectified.

	**Optional:** Use the **SpanId** and open in the **Span Analytics** tab to search and look further into the metadata related to the span.

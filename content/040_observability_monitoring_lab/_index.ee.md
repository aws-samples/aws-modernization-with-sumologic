In this lab, you'll learn how dashboards created based on metrics are instrumental in identifying the root cause of an outage. You’ll use the Root Cause Explorer, a powerful Observability feature of Sumo Logic.

All labs assume you’re using a **training+analyst###@sumologic.com** account. The data you see may vary depending on your environment if you’re using your own credentials or a Sumo Logic trial account instead of a training account. To access a training account, see [Set Up Sumo Logic](/030_self_guided_setup/38_sumo_setup.html).

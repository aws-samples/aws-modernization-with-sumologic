# Investigate and Resolve Service Issues

These labs help you identify and resolve issues with services in your infrastructure. 

Using root cause analysis tools you can identify possible performance bottlenecks causing bad user experiences, failed services that may need to be restarted and problematic actions taken by users that may result in system failures. 

Tracing features allow you to observe apps and microservices at the level of individual requests to pinpoint issues with particular microservices, filtering through trace lists and charts to find troubleshoot faulty transactions. 

These labs help you learn the following topics:

- How Observability can take you beyond monitoring into a comprehensive risk management solution
- How to identify possible performance bottlenecks that may be causing a poor user experience
- How to use Service Maps to identify potential microservice failures
